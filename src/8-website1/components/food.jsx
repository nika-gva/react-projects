                            <p className="main-intro-p">While this Georgian flatbread is occasionally referred to as "Svanetian khachapuri", kubdari contains none of the gooey cheeses of its Imeruli and Acharuli cousins—their defining ingredients. Instead, the Svaneti Georgians traditionally fill their flatbreads with spices and chopped beef, goat, pork, or lamb. Our version uses ground lamb, seasoned with onions, coriander, and paprika. Feel free to swap the lamb out for any of the other meats, or a mix, if you prefer.</p>
